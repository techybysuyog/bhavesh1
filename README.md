    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Deforestation is one of the biggest challenges facing our planet , leading to climate change , loss of biodiversity , and environmental imbalance. Traditional methods of forest monitoring and reforestation are slow , costly, and often ineffective in preventing large-scale damage. To address this , modern technology can provide smart and sustainable solutions.
      GreenGuard AI is a futuristic system that combines artificial intelligence, drones, and satellite data to protect and restore forests. The system continuously monitors forest areas, detects illegal activities, predicts risks , and supports reforestation using drone-based seed planting. It also offers a simple dashboard where authorities and communities can track forest health in real time.
      This project aims to create a smart, technology-driven approach to safeguard nature while making conservation efforts faster , transparent and more effective..
